JATE (Just Another Text Editor) is a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

After installing the application with a click of a button, use the DevTools to inspecy how the application runs behind the scenes.
